My first ever repo(^_^). An android app to test typing speed, created using Android Studio, Programming language Java

I beleive in clean codes, that's one of my many motivations.
I am one of those dudes whose code doesn't make you feel like programming is a death sentence, lol.
Enough of the me, lets talk about the app

The logic is simple, it checks for entered characters and matches it with expected characters, but before that, 
as soon as the user clicks on the "start typing" button or edittext, its actually both, leemao, it starts a timer, 
the timer ends when the last character of the words is entered correctly.

So basically I'm using 2go's star progress to rank the words per minute, lmao.

Just enjoy, nothing too fancy!
